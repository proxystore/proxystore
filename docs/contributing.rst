Getting Started for Local Development
-------------------------------------

A Conda environment file is provided that contains all the necessary packages for local development.

ProxyStore uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ and `Tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/index.html>`_ for code checking and testing.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/gpauloski/ProxyStore.git
   $ cd ProxyStore
   $ tox --devenv venv -e py38
   $ . venv/bin/activate

Alternatively, a Conda environment file is provided.
Note that running Tox in a Conda environment will conflict with Tox's ability to find the correct Python versions.
However, the Conda environment does provide non-pip packages such as Redis that can be used for more in-depth development.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/gpauloski/ProxyStore.git
   $ cd ProxyStore
   $ conda env create --file environment.yml
   $ conda activate ProxyStore


Pre-commit and Tox are used for continuous integration (locally and on GitHub).

To use pre-commit, install the hook and then run against files.
Note that sometimes pre-commit needs to be run multiple times to fix all the issues.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pre-commit install
   $ pre-commit run --all-files

The Python code and docstring format mostly follows the `Google Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_, but the pre-commit config is the authoritative source for code format compliance.

The entire CI workflow can be run with :code:`$ tox`.
This will test against multiple versions of Python and can be slow.

Module-level unit-test are located in the :code:`tests/` directory and its structure is intended to match that of :code:`proxystore/`.
E.g. the tests for :code:`proxystore/store/cache.py` are located in :code:`tests/store/test_cache.py`.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all tests in tests/
   $ tox -e py38
   # Run a specific test
   $ tox -e py38 -- tests/test_factory.py::test_lambda_factory

If code changes require an update to the documentation (e.g., for function signature changes, new modules, etc.), the documentation can be built with :code:`$ tox -e docs`.

The compiled docs can be opened in a browser with :code:`docs/_build/html/index.html`.
Docstrings for existing modules should be autogenerated.
For new modules, a new :code:`.rst` needs to be created in :code:`docs/source/`, and the reference needs to be added to the correct table of content.

Issues
------

We use GitHub issues to report problems, request and track changes, and discuss future ideas.

If you open an issue for a specific problem, please follow the template guides.

Pull Requests
-------------

We use the standard GitHub contribution cycle.

1. Fork the repository and clone to your local machine
2. Create local changes

   - Changes should conform to the style and testing guidelines, referenced above.
   - Commit messages should start with a sentence describing the changes followed by a blank line then a detailed description of what changed and why.

3. Push commits to your fork

   - Please squash commits fixing mistakes to keep the git history clean.
     For example, if commit "b" follows commit "a" and only fixes a small typo from "a", please squash "a" and "b" into a single, correct commit.
4. Open a pull request in this repository

   - The pull request should include a description of the motivation for the PR and included changes.
     A PR template is provided to guide this process.
