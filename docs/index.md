# Welcome to ProxyStore's documentation!

ProxyStore provides a unique interface to object stores through transparent
object proxies that is designed to simplify the use of object stores for
transferring large objects in distributed applications.
ProxyStore's goals are to:

* **Improve productivity.** ProxyStore enables easy decoupling of
  communication from the rest of the code, allowing developers to focus
  on functionality and performance.
* **Improve compatibility.** Consumers of data can be agnostic to the
  communication method because object proxies handle the communication
  behind the scenes.
* **Improve performance.** Transport methods and object stores can be changed
  at runtime to optimal choices for the given data without the consumers
  being aware of the change.

ProxyStore can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/proxystore/proxystore).
